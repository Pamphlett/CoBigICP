# CoBigICP: Correntropy based Bidirectional Generalized ICP #

CoBigICP is a fast and accurate point cloud registration method, currently implemented in MATLAB.

*Reconstruction results of ETH Hauptgebaude generated by CoBigICP and GICP. Both estimated aligned point clouds are colored, with the ground truth being white.*

CoBigICP can solve 3D rigid transformation between two point clouds. It adopts correntropy as the noise model and prunes putative nearest neighbor by a bidirectional search step. Also a symmetric objective function is used to gather surface geometric information. For more information, please refer to our paper. ([pdf](https://github.com/Pamphlett/CoBigICP/blob/master/assets/cobigicp.pdf))

## Registration Example ##
Git clone or download the repo and add to your MATLAB workspace. 

Run *CoBigICP_fun.m* to align two scans from ETH Hauptgebaude.
